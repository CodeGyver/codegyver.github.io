title: Using tmux, vim, and make for microservice development
---

Microservices, due to their modular nature, offer both opportunities and challenges. To develop efficiently in such an environment, choosing the right toolset is crucial. In this post, Iâ€™ll explore the practical applications of tmux, vim, and GNU make in the context of microservice development.

## Development issues with microservice architecture

The outcome of a microservice architecture is a highly modularized application that often spans multiple version control repositories, such as git. Each application comes with its own setup, runner, and database. To perform integration tests, multiple micro-applications often need to run simultaneously. This introduces a practical issue: how can you run each application with its unique internal setup, especially when each has its own port, runner flags, and potentially multiple runner threads? Continually referring to a README (if one exists) or trying to remember each setup might not be efficient.

### Docker compose

One solution is to wrap them in Docker files and define their run recipes in bash scripts that execute the Docker images, or in Docker Compose files. However, in my opinion, this approach might be overkill in many cases. It could be bypassed in favor of launching the application's runner directly on the native machine.

### GNU make

One alternative to Docker is make, specifically GNU Make. GNU Make is a powerful tool primarily used for automating the build process of software projects. It employs Makefile scripts to determine which parts of a program need recompilation and provides a set of rules to generate target outputs from source files. In our case, we won't use it for compilation but rather for executing bash commands. The benefit of using make is its ability to define multiple recipes within a single Makefile, with each recipe representing a distinct task or command.

## Makefile

Let's assume we have a Ruby on Rails application that is started with the command `bundle exec rails c -p 3001` (which starts the Rails server on port 3001) and a JavaScript builder. The recipe could be written as follows:

`Makefile`

    all: js rails
    rails:
        bundle exec rails s -p 3001
    js:
        yarn build --watch

When we execute the recipe using the command `make -j`, it runs all recipes (`rails` and `js`) in parallel, displaying the output in the current terminal window. While this approach achieves the basic goal of consolidating the application's runners into a single Makefile, we can enhance it further by using a terminal multiplexer.

## Tmux

Tmux is a terminal multiplexer that allows users to create, access, and control multiple terminal sessions from a single screen. In our scenario, while we'll use just one local session, we'll leverage its capability to split the terminal into multiple windows and panes.

Assuming we're inside an active tmux session, the revised Makefile recipe might look as follows:

`Makefile`

    all: js rails
    rails:
        tmux split-window -bd "bundle exec rails s -p 3001"
    js:
        tmux split-window -bd "yarn build --watch"

When the recipe is executed this time, each command runs within its own pane, positioned above the active one.

However, there's another nuance: tmux will only split the window in the current (executor) pane. To add flexibility, we can provide the `tmux pane id` to specify where the window should split, which doesn't necessarily have to be the current pane.

The revised code would look like this:

`Makefile`

        all: js rails
        rails:
            tmux split-window -bd -t "$(PANE_ID)" "bundle exec rails s -p 3001"
        js:
            tmux split-window -bd -t "$(PANE_ID)" "yarn build --watch"

And the code can be executed using the command: `PANE_ID=%1 make -j`, where `%1` is the unique pane identifier returned by tmux. How to obtain this identifier will be discussed in the following paragraphs.

## Wrapping up

### Single-Application runner

After wrapping the runner logic in a Makefile, the next step would be to invoke the `make` command from any tmux window and for any project directory. This can be achieved with the following bash script:

`dev.sh`

    #!/bin/bash

    # Setup
    DIRECTORY=$1
    NAME=$(basename $DIRECTORY)

    # Create new window
    VIM_PANE_ID=$(
      tmux new-window -c "$DIRECTORY" -d -n "$NAME" -PF "#{pane_id}"
    )

    # Split window
    MAKE_PANE_ID=$(
      tmux split-window -c "$DIRECTORY" -d -h -t $VIM_PANE_ID -PF "#{pane_id}"
    )

    # Run vim
    tmux send-keys -t "$VIM_PANE_ID" "vim" Enter

    # Run make
    tmux send-keys -t "$MAKE_PANE_ID" "make PANE_ID=$MAKE_PANE_ID -f Makefile" Enter

The script mentioned above should be executed with the Makefile directory as its parameter, for example: `dev.sh ~/git/ruby_on_rails_app_1`. What it does is create a `tmux` window using the given directory as the starting point, run vim in the left pane, and the make command in the right pane. For convenience, the tmux window is named after the last directory (in this case, `ruby_on_rails_app1`).

### Multi-Application runner

After defining the runners for all the applications we want to run simultaneously, we can further refine the `dev_all.sh` script:

`dev_all.sh`

    #!/bin/bash

    directories=(
      ~/git/ruby_on_rails_app_1
      ~/git/ruby_on_rails_app_2
      ~/git/nextjs_app_1
    )

    for directory in "${directories[@]}"; do
      dev.sh $directory
    done

The script, `dev_all.sh`, can be executed during machine boot-up to run all our applications according to their respective Makefile recipes.

## Conclusions

Automating microservice development with tmux, vim, and make boosts efficiency. Tmux handles multiple terminal windows and panes, vim offers advanced text editing, and make automates build and run commands. This setup eliminates the need to recall specific runner code, particularly in multi-app environments like microservices.
