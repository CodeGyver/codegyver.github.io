Hey there!

My name is Zbigniew Pieślak. I'm full stack developer / software architect with {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus:2008 }} years of experience. I'm based in Poznań, Poland (CET).

My main area of expertise is:

* Architect web applications (monolithic and microservice)
* Test and behavior driven development (Ruby, Python, Node)
* Amazon AWS solutions (design and implementation)
* SQL and NoSQL Databases (design and implementation)
* CI / CD pipelines (design and implementation)
* DevOps tasks (Linux, Bash, Ansible)

In my free time I like spending it with my family, doing exercises (running, gym) and performing some home repairs.

Feel free to contact me via email [zpieslak(at)gmail.com](mailto:&#122;&#112;&#105;&#101;&#115;&#108;&#97;&#107;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;)
